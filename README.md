KPAKit
=============

This is the start of collecting all classes I use regularly on a regular basis, into one place.

Includes useful categories for the following classes:
- NSArray + NSMutableArray
- NSData
- UIView (Many methods to greatly enhance your layout code)
- UINavigationController
- NSNumber

Includes useful subclasses for UIView and UIViewController to make laying out your code more automatic.

Includes a high performance tree object.

Also includes useful general functions for GCD and geometry.
